# Dark Souls Equipment Planner

## Overview
The **Dark Souls Equipment Planner** is a lightweight, browser-based tool designed to help Dark Souls players optimize their equipment loadouts. Calculate the best armor combinations based on your stats, prioritize specific defenses, manage your inventory, and exclude unwanted items. The website saves your state locally using browser storage, so your data remains safe unless you clear it.
